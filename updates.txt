# A list of updates that would make workrails catalogs easier to test - Basit

1) https:/ /services.workrails.com/ - All buttons with text "Learn more" on the main page would benefit from having unique id's though for this website
  it is not really necessary since there are no conflicting buttons in the catalogListViewItems div tag

2) https://champion.workrails.com , https://erwin.workrails.com/ , https://greenhouse.workrails.com/ , https://liveperson.workrails.com/ ,- All buttons with text "Learn more" on the main page would benefit from having unique id's because there are two
  buttons in each catalogItem contained in the catalogListViewItems div tag. I would also look into removing the additional button under
  class "sowBuilder" in each catalog item because it does not seem to be accessible on the web page since the whole catalog itself is a hyperlink. This issue
  can also be handled by removing the button with class name "added" from the list of all returned buttons in the puppeteer script since the additional button
  in each catalog item has a class name.

3) https://gainsight.workrails.com/ , https://kustomer.workrails.com/ , https://confluent.workrails.com/ - Cant access catalogs without login

4) https://newsela.workrails.com - Can't access catalogs without login and this page has a different layout. The link redirects to a newsela hosted page in contrast to others websites which are
  workrails pages.

5) https://ptc.workrails.com/ - This page would require a different script to test because it has different tags. there is no need to id buttons here because the
  "Learn More" buttons in the catalogs have a class which seperates them from other types of buttons

6) https://veeva.workrails.com - This page is also different from other pages in terms of the layout. It does not contain the standard "Learn More" button and instead contains
  a get started button and each button contains a different class name. Might benefit from having same class name or id's that make it easier to test.
